# Deep-Learning in Practice with Python and LUA (BMEVITMAV45)
## First assignment

1. In Python / LUA, read five arbitrary 128x128 pixel color images, display and print the contents of arrays (matrices, tensors) containing RGB channels.
2. Calculate the average and standard deviation of each pixel per channel for the five images, and then convert them to a dataset with an expected value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then check the expected value and standard deviation of the resulting dataset.
3. Read any audio file in Python / LUA and display its spectrogram.
4. Using a Python / LUA script, download the textual content of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning, display the textual content, and display the frequency of the letters in the content in a histogram.
