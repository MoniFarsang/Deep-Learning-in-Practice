# Deep-Learning in Practice with Python and LUA (BMEVITMAV45)
## Second assignment

Implement the following functions in the code of the Numpy-based neural network described in the course:

1. Momentum
2. L1 and L2 regularization

Put the new parts of the source code in the comments “# HF2 start procedure” and “# HF2 end procedure” (procedure = momentum, l1reg, l2reg) and write comments about exactly what you did and why.

Try to keep the code as short as possible! Submit your homework in English!
